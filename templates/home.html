    <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
<p>Well hello there, welcome to Dieren Theater!</p>
<p>Right now you are probably asking yourself a legitimate question, what is Dieren Theater? Dieren Theater is a project to offer to anyone structured and open data extracted (in fact scraped) from the website of the Belgian parliament (also knows as La Chambre or De Kamer).</p>
<p>Again, you might are asking yourself "Why? What is the meaning of that?". Well in fact, open data is one of the first step for us citizens to appropriate ourself political informations (political as in « the life of the city »), the way it is treated and displayed, to move from passive consumer to active creator and to get involve in this democratic process.</p>
<p>Sound to theoretical? Lets me show you some example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.nosdeputes.fr/">Nos Députés.fr</a> and <a href="http://www.nossenateurs.fr/">Nos Sénateurs.fr</a> (both in french), two website from <a href="http://www.regardscitoyens.org/">Regards Citoyens</a> (a citizen group) that allow us to see the activities of the French deputies and senators, the subject they are the most working on, their interventions and many others informations. Those informations wasn't displayed in that what at all on the French parliament website.</li>
    <li><a href="http://memopol.lqdn.fr">The Political Memory</a> (English) which is a tool that allow an organization (here <a href="http://laquadrature.net">La Quadrature du Net</a>) to put online the voting recommendations they have been sending to elected representatives (here deputies of the European Parliament and French deputies) and show who is following their recommendations the best. This allow here for example to see which elected representatives is the more for Fundamental Freedoms, Net Neutrality and other in the sens that defend la Quadrature du Net.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pippi.euwiki.org/">Pippi Longstrings</a> (English) which is a tool to do text analysis on European Laws related documents and to see for example (but not only) which documents have text in common</li>
    <li><a href="http://parltrack.euwiki.org">Parltrack</a> (English) which allows to track the legislative work of the European Parliament especially by following dossiers and/or committees.</li>
    <li><a href="http://coulmont.com/blog/2011/09/02/travail-de-deputes/">An interesting visualisation</a> (French) by <a href="http://coulmont.com/">Baptise Coulmont</a> which display the relations betweens French deputies based on how often they have been working together (by proposing laws).</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those would have been possible without data and none of this has yet happen (in my knowledge) in Belgium. So Dieren Theater is an attempt to build the first step by providing data to everyone and therefor allowing everyone to build similar tools or analysis.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notes that (except Baptise Coulmont works) all of this website are Free software (as in speech).</p>
